// to define a sector's walls, list the sector's vertices after creating it, with a space between x and y, and a , between each vertex
// you can add textures by writing the texture's name in between the 2 vertices of the wall. if the wall is connected to sectors, you
// can add different textures for each section of the wall by listing multiple textures in descending order of which section
// should use them (high -> low)

// you can add adjoins (connections to other sectors) by writing ADJ and then listing the sectors this wall connects to

// other keywords are used here to modify the tiling attributes. TX and TY shift the texture X and Y, SCALEX and SCALEY scale the tiling x
// and y, with SCALE doing both at the same time, and just writing STRETCHX or STRETCHY turns off tiling and stretches the texture out
// over the wall.

// these wall attributes are always capitalized, while textures are not

// note, currently you need to write the walls in clockwise (going right from inside) order
